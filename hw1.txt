I am interested in taking CMSC320 because I wish to pursue research or a career in deep learning, a field that relies heavily on fundamental skills that I will develop through learning data science. In this course, I will be able to learn about data processing, statistics, data visualizations, and more, which will all help me understand how to extract well-organized data to train neural networks in deep learning. Moreover, I am also interested in this course as we cover many basic machine learning techniques like regression and classification that transfer over to more advanced deep learning work.
